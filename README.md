# VGA-Benchmark
Pascal source code for a VGA benchmark tool I wrote over 20 years ago. The program measures the throughput and pixel fill rate of graphics cards under DOS. It also compares the speed of the Bios functions with the speed of writing directly to the screen memory.

Certainly an interesting tool for collectors of old hardware.
